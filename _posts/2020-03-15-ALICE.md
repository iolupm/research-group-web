UPM in part of The European Technology Platform ALICE.

ETP ALICE is set-up to develop a comprehensive strategy for research, innovation and market deployment of logistics and supply chain management innovation in Europe.

The platform will support and assist the implementation of the EU Program for research: Horizon 2020.

ALICE is based on the recognition of the need for an overarching view on logistics and supply chain planning and control, in which shippers and logistics service providers closely collaborate to reach efficient logistics and supply chain operations.
