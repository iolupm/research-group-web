title: Implementation of a reverse logistics model for installing collection and recovery plants to process the nearby towns’ waste

description: |
  The model minimizes the overall costs of plants placement and waste flow, as well as the unpleasant effect that these facilities cause in nearby populations. In addition, it considers stochastic transportation costs and waste generation. 
  
  Said model implements Benders decomposition using the Gurobi optimization solver through the Gurobi Python interface.
